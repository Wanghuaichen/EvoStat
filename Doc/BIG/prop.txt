Abstract:
Continuous Evolution systems (PACE, PATHE) provide a powerful approach to protein engineering to increase Protein-DNA and Protein-Protein binding affinities through directed evolution.  Ad-hoc systems built from commercially available equipment have material costs on the order of ~$30,000.00 as well as high personell costs because of the requirement of continuous monitoring.  Alternatively, by using inexpensive computational systems, commodity electronic and plumbing componets and a few custom 3D-printed components a system can be built for $1000-$2000 which additionally eliminates much of the manpower requirement through non-contact sensing, image processing, and computer controlled feedback.  This inexpensive, easy-to-use apparatus will be able to support high-throughput directed evolution protein engineering.
